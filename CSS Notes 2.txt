CSS Notes 2:

Simple Selectors:

--> TagName
--> Id Name(#)
--> Class Name(.)
--> Universal(*)
--> Grouping(,)

<!-- TagName -->

-> To Target the element based on tagname itself we have to use tagName selector.
-> The Symbol was the tagname itself.

<!-- Universal -->

-> It will Target all the elements in the document including body tag too.
-> The Symbol used is asterisk(*).

<!-- Id Name -->

-> To Target the elements uniquely we have to use an id name.
-> In CSS id name can be duplicated also there is no problem.
<!-- But once we moved to advanced languages, Repetation of id name will not work. So it is highly recommended not to use it from now on... -->
-> The Symbol used is Hash(#).

<!-- Class Name -->

-> When we want to give same CSS to more than one elements then we have to use class.
-> The Symbol used is dot(.).

<!-- Grouping -->

-> To Target multiple elements at  time we have to use a grouping selector
-> Whenever we need to pass similar properties for multiple elements we can use a grouping selector.
-> The Symbol used to combine all the elements is comma(,).
