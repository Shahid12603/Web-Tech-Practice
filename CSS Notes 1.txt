CSS Notes 1: 

1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet
2. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen.
3. It is used to add styling and aligning the property.

We can add CSS in 3 Ways:
1. Inline CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. External CSS

Inline CSS :
--> It is way of writing the CSS in same line.
--> For this we need style attribute.

Internal CSS:
--> It is the way of writing the CSS in the same HTML file using <style> </style> tag.

<!-- Syntax of Selector -->

selectorName {
	propertyName: Value;
	propertyName: Value;
	.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	propertyName: Value;
}


External CSS:
--> Here we are writing out CSS code in separate CSS file.
--> For Creating CSS file we need .CSS file
--> Then we have to link our CSS file with our html file.
--> For that we need <link> tag
--> In <link> tag we have two attributes. (rel, href)

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">

<!-- Notes -->

--> If we apply inline, internal and external CSS on the same element. The Inline CSS will be applied.
--> Internal and external CSS has same priority. Which one will be at the end, that will be applied.
